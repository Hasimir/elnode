* doing django style client unit test
** elnode--filter
*** WE COULD
**** call filter with a full HTTP request
**** override elnode--get-server-handler
***** to produce whatever handler... define as part of the test?
*** initialization
**** process-put
***** :send-string-function
***** :send-eof-function
****** these could both go into the sentinel eventually?
**** process-buffer
***** insert data
****** data is the filter data
*** parse data
**** we know this works, we have tests
*** on full header
**** process-get :elnode-header-end
**** elnode--get-server-handler process
***** to get the server level handler
